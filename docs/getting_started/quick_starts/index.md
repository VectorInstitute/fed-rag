# Quick Starts

<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD041 MD033 MD042 -->

In this next part in getting to know FedRAG, we provide a mini series of two
quick start examples in order to get a better feeling of the library.

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

- :material-hexagon-outline: [__Centralized to Federated__](./federated.md) — Transform
  a centralized training task into a federated learning task.
- :material-hexagon-outline: [__Build a RAG System__](./rag_inference.md) — Assemble
  a RAG System using FedRAG's lightweight abstractions.
