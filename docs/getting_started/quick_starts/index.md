<!-- markdownlint-disable-file MD041 MD033 MD042 -->

In this next part in getting to know FedRAG, we provide a mini series of
quick start examples in order to get a better feeling of the library.

- :material-hexagon-outline: [__Centralized to Federated__](./federated.md) — Transform
  a centralized training task into a federated learning task.
- :material-hexagon-outline: [__Build a RAG System__](./rag_inference.md) — Assemble
  a RAG System using FedRAG's lightweight abstractions.
- :material-hexagon-outline: [__Fine-tune a RAG System__](./rag_inference.md) — Fine-tune
  a RAG system on custom QA data, demonstrating both centralized training and
  optional federation capabilities.
