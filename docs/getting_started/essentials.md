# Essentials

To get to know FedRAG a bit better and understand its purpose, we provide the
answers to the following four essential questions.

## Four Essential Questions

### What is RAG?

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a widely used technique that addresses a main drawback of Large Language Models (LLM), which is that they're trained on
historical corpora and thus answering user queries that heavily rely on recent data
are not really possible. Further, using the parametric knowledge of LLMs alone
has yielded subpar performance on knowledge-intensive benchmarks.

RAG provides access to relevant (and potentially more recent) non-parametric
knowledge (i.e. data) that are stored in _Knowledge Stores_ to the LLM so that it
can use it in order to more accurately respond to user queries.
