# Ask a Question

We welcome questions from users and contributors at all levels of experience with
FedRAG. Having questions is a natural part of engaging with a complex project,
and we're here to help.

## Where to Ask Questions

FedRAG offers several channels for asking questions:

- **Discord Community**: Join our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/5GMpSCFbTe)
for real-time discussions and quick questions.

- **GitHub Discussions**: For longer, more detailed questions, use
[GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/fed-rag/discussions).
This is ideal for questions that might benefit the wider community.
