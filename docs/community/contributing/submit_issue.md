# Submitting an Issue

Issues are an important way to track bugs, feature requests, and improvements to
FedRAG.

## Before Creating an Issue

Before submitting a new issue:

1. **Search existing issues**: Check [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/fed-rag/issues)
to see if your problem has already been reported or if a related feature request exists.

2. **Check the documentation**: Verify that your question isn't already addressed
in our documentation.

3. **Confirm it's an issue**: For general questions, please use [GitHub Discussions](https://github.com/VectorInstitute/fed-rag/discussions)
or our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/5GMpSCFbTe) instead.

We appreciate your contributions to making FedRAG better through thoughtful issue submissions!
